# ESP32-Solar-Weather-Station
ESP32 - Solar Powered Weather Station w/ long range communication

Welcome to the repository for the ESP32 Solar Weather Station. This DIY weather monitoring project encompasses a diverse range of skills, from hardware design and coding to power optimization and 3D modeling. The project was driven by the goal of creating a sustainable, long-range weather station capable of collecting and transmitting data in real-time.

# Power Management Strategies:
Power efficiency is crucial, especially in periods without sunlight. Voltage dividers monitor solar panel and battery voltages, enabling the ESP32 to enter a deep-sleep mode when the battery is low. A sensor power switch selectively activates sensors, minimizing power consumption. Explore the power management section in the code for detailed insights.

# Getting Started:

# Prerequisites:
Arduino IDE
ESP32 board support

# Installation:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Arduino IDE, load the project files, and upload the code to your ESP32.

# Future Plans (V2):

The upcoming iteration will focus on refining the code for enhanced efficiency. Future plans also include optimizing the enclosure and PCB layout for a more compact design. For detailed insights into the PCB and project design, refer to the project listing associated with this project below.
